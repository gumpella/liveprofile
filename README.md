ABOUT the project:

  I have created a webpage making use of REACT.
  
  The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of REST APIs.
  
  Github's profile REST API is used here.
  
  The code fetches the REST API and delivers the selected data onto the webpage.
  
  In this case, the project fetches name, location and github avatar of user from GITHUB's profile REST API.
